  <strong>Prepared:</strong> June 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Quarter in Review – Q2 2025</h2>
  <h3>United States</h3>
  <p><strong>1. Legislative Push to Restore Full R&D Expensing (Section 174)</strong><br>
  A bipartisan coalition in Congress is advancing H.R.1990, the <em>American Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act</em>, which would retroactively reinstate full expensing of R&D costs from 2022 onward. This change would reverse the TCJA’s amortization rule, potentially unlocking billions in refunds for tech, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical companies. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1990" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <p><strong>2. IRS Form 6765 Section G Becomes Mandatory in 2025</strong><br>
  Starting tax year 2025, the IRS will require expanded disclosures via Form 6765 to include Section G, requiring taxpayers to report business component-level detail on qualified research activities and expenses. This mandates stronger documentation systems, particularly for software and integrated engineering projects. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f6765--dft.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
  <p><strong>3. Unified RDEC Regime for All Companies</strong><br>
  As of April 2024, the UK has fully merged its SME and large company schemes into the R&D Expenditure Credit (RDEC) system. While simplifying administration, the shift reduces benefits for some SMEs, sparking debate over future competitiveness. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spring-budget-2023" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <p><strong>4. HMRC Prepares for Mandatory Advance Assurance</strong><br>
  In response to £4.1 billion in historic R&D claim fraud, HMRC is piloting a policy to mandate advance assurance—especially for first-time filers or high-risk sectors. This adds a pre-claim compliance gate, demanding robust technical narratives and audit-ready documentation. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hmrc-overhaul-8bn-tax-credit-scheme-faces-reform-sntmmg80m" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <h3>Canada</h3>
  <p><strong>5. SR&ED Remains the World’s Most Generous R&D Program</strong><br>
  Canada continues to lead globally with its SR&ED program, offering 35% refundable credits federally and stacking with provincial incentives to reach up to 64% total subsidy. The program remains attractive for R&D-intensive SMEs and multinationals with Canadian hubs. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <h3>Australia</h3>
  <p><strong>6. Quarterly R&D Refund Model Under Consideration</strong><br>
  The Australian government is consulting on a potential shift to quarterly R&D tax credit refunds. With SMEs already benefiting from 43.5% refundable offsets, quarterly payment would dramatically improve cash flow and reinvestment velocity. <a href="https://budget.gov.au" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

  <h1>Innovation Catalyst | Q2 2025 Global R&D Tax Incentives Digest</h1>
  <p><strong>Audience:</strong> CFOs, CTOs, Finance Leaders<br>
  <strong>Prepared:</strong> June 2025</p>

  <h2>3. Emerging Global Trends</h2>
  <p><strong>Income-Based Relief:</strong> Tax incentives are evolving beyond input-focused models. Countries like the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands are increasingly leveraging "innovation boxes" and IP-based incentives. These reward companies based on income generated from patents or qualifying intellectual property, encouraging commercialization of R&D outcomes. This model encourages long-term investment and a strategic focus on value capture.</p>

  <p><strong>Refundable, Cash-First Models:</strong> Governments are shifting toward cash-based incentives. Canada and Australia offer refundable credits that can be claimed even without tax liability. Australia is now piloting quarterly R&D refunds, enabling faster capital recycling for high-growth companies. This is a significant change from annual claims, easing working capital pressures and enabling continuous reinvestment in innovation.</p>

  <p><strong>Real-Time Audit Readiness:</strong> Documentation requirements are rising globally. The IRS now mandates Form 6765 Section G, which requires detailed business component-level evidence. Similarly, HMRC is pushing for digital narratives under the Advance Assurance program. These developments demand that companies adopt real-time tracking, robust internal systems, and automated claim documentation frameworks to withstand audits.</p>

  <p><strong>Cross-Border Claim Risk:</strong> OECD guidance has flagged the risk of duplicate claims and jurisdictional overlap. Multinational corporations must implement intercompany R&D policies that allocate costs accurately and demonstrate local substance. This includes tracking R&D performed in each country, maintaining transfer pricing documentation, and avoiding double-dipping where local funding or ownership may disqualify foreign claims.</p>

  <p><strong>AI and Software Legitimized:</strong> AI model development, machine learning infrastructure, software engineering, and even data science are increasingly being recognized under R&D definitions. Countries like the UK and Australia have clarified eligibility to include these areas, responding to industry demand. This helps software-centric companies claim credits with greater confidence, aligning policy with modern innovation practices.</p>

  <h2>4. Strategic Metrics</h2>
  <p><strong>34 out of 38 OECD Countries Use R&D Incentives:</strong> The widespread adoption of R&D tax incentives reflects a global consensus that tax-based mechanisms are critical to national innovation strategies. It is now a baseline policy tool for most industrial economies.</p>

  <p><strong>~55% of R&D Support Delivered via Tax Relief:</strong> OECD data shows that more than half of public R&D funding is now provided through tax incentives rather than direct grants. This reduces administrative burden on governments and increases flexibility for businesses.</p>

  <p><strong>SMEs Receive Higher Average Subsidy (19%) vs Large Firms (16%):</strong> Policy structures favor small businesses with higher rates, refundability, and fewer thresholds, recognizing the cash constraints faced by early-stage and growth-phase companies.</p>

  <p><strong>UK Fraud Exposure – £4.1 Billion:</strong> The magnitude of non-compliant claims in the UK has led to an aggressive policy shift. HMRC is using risk-based targeting, requiring narrative evidence and planning mandatory advance assurance, signaling a zero-tolerance posture going forward.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia Disbursed $3B in R&D Credits to 11,500 Firms:</strong> The scale and reach of Australia's program highlight its effectiveness. Planned quarterly disbursements will further solidify Australia’s role as a leader in accessible, liquidity-focused R&D support.</p>

  <h2>5. Finance Leader Action Plan – Q3</h2>
  <p><strong>Revisit U.S. Filings for Retroactive Claims:</strong> Model and prepare amended returns in light of pending Section 174 reversal. Use this window to recover cash from 2022–2024 amortized R&D expenses if legislative reform succeeds.</p>

  <p><strong>Modernize Documentation Systems:</strong> Implement traceability at the project and business-component level. Prepare for new IRS and HMRC standards that rely on real-time data, structured narratives, and audit-ready documentation pipelines.</p>

  <p><strong>Align R&D Geography with IP and Refundability Strategy:</strong> Evaluate R&D site selection in light of income-based tax relief (e.g., patent boxes) and refund-focused regimes (e.g., Australia, Canada). Factor refundability and certainty into capital planning decisions.</p>

  <p><strong>Integrate Refund Cycles into Working Capital Plans:</strong> Account for quarterly or fast-track refund programs in forecasting. Adjust R&D budget timing and disbursement to align with these liquidity benefits and improve R&D velocity.</p>

  <p><strong>Establish Intercompany R&D Governance:</strong> MNCs should centralize R&D policy across legal entities. Ensure alignment of cost-sharing agreements, IP ownership, and claim rules to reduce audit risk and maximize jurisdictional value capture.</p>
